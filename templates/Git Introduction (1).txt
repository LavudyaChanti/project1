GIT:
==

Git is an indispensable part of modern software development. 
It is a "version control system" which can be thought of as an extremely powerful version of track changes 
in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. 
With git, 
	1.you can collaborate with other developers, 
	2.track all your work via commits,
	3.revert to any previous version of your code even if you accidentally delete something important!

Install Git On Windows you should download Git from git site. 

Once installed, we need to do a one-time system setup to configure it 
by declaring the name and email address you want associated with all your Git commits.

Checking :
===========
	git	--version

Procedure:
===========
Within the command line console type the following two lines. 
Make sure to update them your name and email address.

> git config --global user.name "Your Name"
> git config --global user.email "yourname@email.com"

You can always change these configs later if you desire by retyping the same commands 
with a new name or email address.

The first step is to initialize (or add) git to our repository.

	$ git init

If you then type git status you’ll see a list of changes since the last git commit. 
Since this is our first commit, this list is all of our changes so far.

	$ git status


We next want to add all changes by using the command add -A and then commit the 
changes along with a message describing what has changed.

	$ git add -A
	$ git commit -m 'initial commit'



To modify ur code into git:
============================
